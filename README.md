# Inventory-System-V2
 This is the second version of my Inventory System.
 Compared to my first version this version uses an ID system for each item to prevent duplicate items to not work.
 The CSV Files from version one are **NOT** compatible with this version. (To make them compatiable you will need to give each item an ID (in the first column))

## Download
To download go to the releases on this project and download the latest version.
If there is not a version for your OS or architecture then you can compile it your self by downloading the source code and compiling it yourself.
I will not document here how to compile Golang Code.
